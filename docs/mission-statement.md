# Proletariat Budget - Mission Statement

## Our Purpose

Proletariat Budget is a collaborative FOSS financial management tool designed to empower working individuals and households to take control of their economic lives within the broader context of systemic socioeconomic conditions. We believe that personal financial management is not merely an individual responsibility but exists within collective economic structures that impact our daily choices and opportunities. We believe in a household collaboration, because "from each according to their ability, to each according to their needs"; even though a household is neither capable or applicable to work as a commune under capitalism, it can try. 

## Our Values

### Economic Solidarity
We recognize that financial struggles are often the result of systemic inequalities rather than personal failings. Our platform provides tools that contextualize your financial situation within broader economic trends in your region, helping you understand how external factors influence your financial reality.

### Collective Empowerment
Financial knowledge should not be a privilege. We democratize financial planning by making it accessible, understandable, and adaptable to diverse economic circumstances, promoting financial literacy as a tool for collective liberation.

### Transparent Collaboration
We facilitate household financial cooperation through transparent sharing of expenses, savings goals, and budgeting decisions. By breaking down financial silos within families and communities, we foster mutual support and shared responsibility.

### Critical Consumption
Our platform encourages mindful spending by helping users evaluate their consumption patterns against both personal values and the social and environmental impact of their choices, promoting an economy of needs rather than manufactured desires.

### Collective Household Economics
We acknowledge that today's global economic pressures have made individual financial independence increasingly difficult to achieve. Our tools are built with the understanding that modern survival often requires pooling resources within households and communities. We provide features specifically designed for multi-income households, shared expenses, and collective decision-makingâ€”recognizing that financial collaboration is not just a preference but a necessity in today's economy. By facilitating transparent resource sharing and collective budgeting, we help households maximize their collective economic power while respecting individual needs and contributions.

### Sustainable Planning
We help users build financial resilience through practical savings strategies and goal-setting that acknowledges both individual aspirations and collective well-being, preparing for personal security while working toward a more equitable economic system.

## Our Commitment

Proletariat Budget commits to developing tools that serve the financial needs of working people while acknowledging the broader economic forces that shape our lives. We strive to create technology that doesn't just help individuals navigate an unequal system, but contributes to the collective understanding necessary to transform it.

Together, we can build financial security while working toward an economy that serves everyone's needs.
